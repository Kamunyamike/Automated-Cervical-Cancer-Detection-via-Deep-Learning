# Automated-Cervical-Cancer-Detection-via-Deep-Learning
Deep learning CNN for automated cervical cancer detection using Pap smear images, with Streamlit deployment &amp; Grad‑CAM.
This project implements a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for automated cervical cancer detection using Pap smear imagery from the SIPaKMeD dataset. The model achieves ~94% validation accuracy and 91% test accuracy, reliably classifying normal, HPV-infected, and precancerous cells. Built with TensorFlow/Keras, the system is designed for deployment via Streamlit, offering an interactive interface for real-time inference. Future enhancements include Grad-CAM visualizations for interpretability, mobile/edge deployment for accessibility in low-resource settings, and clinical validation to strengthen trust and adoption.
